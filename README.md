Please be patient as this mathematician stretches her programming legs!

About Me: I'm Katrina Tea√±o [teh-AH-nyo], a mathematician transitioning from someone who teaches math to someone who actually does the math. I have a BS in Applied Math and an MS in Operations Research from Florida Institute of Technology, a quickly growing science and engineering university in Melbourne, Florida, just south of Kennedy Space Center. 

I'm fascinated by statistics, optimization, and machine learning, and am trying to learn all the time!
